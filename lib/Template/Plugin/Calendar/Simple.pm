=head1 NAME

Template::Plugin::Calendar::Simple - Just another TT plugin for Calendar::Simple

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  [% USE cal = Calendar.Simple %]

  <table border="1">
    <tr>
    [% FOREACH day = cal.days %]
      <th>[% day %]</th>
    [% END %]
    </tr>
    [% FOREACH row = cal.rows %]
    <tr>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides calendar delimiters for a Template Toolkit template. You supply the HTML.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<new()>

Constructor. Will be called for you by the Template Toolkit engine.

=item C<rows()>

   [% FOREACH row = cal.rows %]

Returns a Template::Iterator which contains the calendar rows.
Each row, however, is simply an array.

=item C<days()>

   [% FOREACH day = cal.days %]

Most calendars have a header with the days - this method returns
an array of abbreviated day names (currently only in English). If
any argument is passed, then the week day starts with Monday instead
of Sunday.
